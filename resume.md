PROJECTS   
CHATBOT USING AMAZON LEX                                                                                                                   
xx/xxxx – xx/xxxx 
• Developed an interactive chatbot with dynamic content handling as measured by successful third-party API 
interactions, by using Amazon Lex and integrating it with AWS Lambda. 
• Enhanced chatbot functionality and session management as measured by improved user interaction and data storage 
capabilities, by utilizing Amazon S3, DynamoDB. 
• Ensured accurate responses and a seamless user experience as measured by extensive testing, debugging, and 
performance monitoring, by leveraging AWS CloudWatch for continuous monitoring and optimization. 
MACHINE LEARNING MODEL MONITORING USING AIRFLOW AND DOCKER                            
08/2024 – 10/2024 
• Developed an automated pipeline with Apache Airflow and Docker to monitor machine learning models resulting in a 
30% reduction in manual intervention and deployment issues. 
• Implemented logging and alerting mechanisms within Airflow to provide real-time notifications and performance 
checks which increased model reliability and response times. 
• Containerized the model monitoring application using Docker to ensure consistent and reproducible environments 
leading to a 20% decrease in deployment issues. 
TEXT SUMMARISER                                                                                                                                           
06/2024 - 07/2024 
● Accomplished scalable and secure text summarization deployment as measured by high availability and 
optimized performance, by utilizing AWS services (EC2, IAM) and conducting thorough performance tuning. 
● Achieved streamlined and automated deployment process as measured by reduced manual intervention and faster release 
cycles, by implementing CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and leveraging Docker for containerization. 
● Delivered a robust and user-friendly summarization tool as measured by seamless integration and continuous delivery, 
by configuring and managing EC2 instances, automating deployment workflows, and collaborating with team members. 
TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF GROUNDWATER CHANGE USING GRAVITY RECOVERY AND CLIMATE 
EXPERIMENT                                                                                                                                                       
12/2023 – 04/2024 
● Led this project to accomplish comprehensive data wrangling, successfully handling GLDAS, NetCDF, and GeoTIFF 
data using Python and Panoply, and visualizing the data with ArcMap and Quantum GIS. 
● Identified an average groundwater declination of 5.877 cm per year as measured by analysis of GRACE 
satellite data, by examining changes in groundwater levels across the Cauvery River basin from 2003 to 2022. 
● Predicted a mean annual variation in groundwater thickness of approximately -26.179 cm as measured by 
detailed study over the period from 2003 to 2022, by analyzing and modeling the data to determine significant 
groundwater changes.
